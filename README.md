## Disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.
Pyber, an on-line ride sharing company, would like to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 


## Overview of the analysis:
Although rural drivers make a higher average fare per ride, they end up losing dearly in the end. They have 8% as many rides as drivers in urban environments (There were 125 rural rides in comparison to 1625 urban rides in the time frame documented). This means that ultimately, rural drivers walk away with 10.86% of the earnings of urban drivers during a comparable time period. 

The suburban drivers come away with half of the earnings of the urban drivers but the fleet is only a fifth of the urban driving fleet. They only have 38% of the number of rides the urban drivers have, and thier average fare is a little more than double that of urban drivers.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
I suggest
1) doing a customer research study to determine if the lack of ride sharing in rural neighborhoods is because 1)there aren't enough drivers slowing down the process of a successful and fast service; or because the need is less, and therefor the drivers are available but are getting fewer rides because there is less demand. 
2) I would also do customer research in the suburban areas. This is a more competitive field for the drivers and it would also be interesting in these communities to find out if the limiting factor is lack of drivers, or lack of demand. In the suburban areas I would be tempted to increase the fleet to see if that improved service will boost the demand. 
3) Finally, I would maintain the urban service at the level to which it is already being provided.
